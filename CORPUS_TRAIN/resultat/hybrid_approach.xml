<abstract> In this paper a sentence compression tool is described. We describe how an input sentence gets analysed by using a.o. a tagger, a shallow parserribed. We describe how an input sentence gets and a subordinate clause detector, and how, basedribed. We describe how an input sentence gets on this analysis, several compressed versions of thisd. We describe how an input sentence gets sentence are generated, each with an associated estimated probability. These probabilities were estimated from a parallel transcript/subtitle corpus. To avoid ungrammatical sentences, the tool also makestimated probability. These probabilities were estimated from a parallel transcript/subtitle corpus. To use of a number of rules. The evaluation was donestimated probability. These probabilities were estimated from a parallel transcript/subtitle corpus. To on three different pronunciation speeds, averagingtimated probability. These probabilities were estimated from a parallel transcript/subtitle corpus. To sentence reduction rates of 40% to 17%.
