<abstract> This paper investigates a novel application of support vector machines (SVMs) for sentence reduction. We also propose a new probabilistic sentence reduction method based on support vector machine learning. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform earlier methods in term of sentence reduction performance.t vector machine learning.
